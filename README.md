# booklist
A personal reading list manager to help keep track of books you have read and books that you want to read.

## Database
You can find a diagram of the [database structure on dbdiagram](https://dbdiagram.io/d/62d06ae1cc1bc14cc5be9b72)
Currently consists of a table of books and a table of authors with a joining table so we can support books with multiple authors as well as authors with multiple books.

## TODO
This is a list of things to add after MVP is achieved.
- Add date tracking for releases, when it was read, and when it was recommended
